Job Application Tracker Web App — Developer Specification
1. Overview
A lightweight, fully static web application for individual job seekers to track their job applications with an engaging modernized 8-bit visual theme and interactive gamification. The app is focused on tracking job applications, statuses, and statistics locally on the user’s device without any backend or user accounts.

2. Users & Access
Single-user (solo use) only, no multi-account or sharing features

Data persists locally on the device (using localStorage or IndexedDB)

No authentication or cloud sync

No export/import features

3. Core Features & Requirements
3.1 Application Tracking
Each job application stores:

Company name (string)

Job title (string)

Date applied (date)

Application status (enum):

Applied

Interviewing

Offer

Rejected

Ghosted

Link to job posting (URL string)

Salary range (string or numeric range)

Contact info (string)

Notes (rich text with formatting: bold, italics, links, lists, images)

Job type (enum):

Full-time

Part-time

Internship

Contract

Freelance

Temporary

3.2 CRUD Operations
Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for applications

One application added at a time through a form

Manual status updates only (no email parsing)

Text and links only; no file uploads

3.3 Search & Filtering
Keyword search (matches company name, job title, notes)

Filters:

Date applied (date range)

Salary range

Alphabetical sort (by company or job title)

3.4 Dashboard & Statistics
Dashboard showing:

Applications per month (bar or line chart)

Funnel spider web chart tracking progress from Applied → Interviewing → Offer

Responsive design working well on desktop and mobile

3.5 Gamification
XP system tied to actions:

Add application: 10 XP

Update status: 5 XP

Add/edit notes: 3 XP

Categorize by job type: 2 XP

Bonus XP for reaching Interview (10 XP) and Offer (20 XP) statuses

Optional penalty: deleting application (-5 XP)

Level progression bar

Fixed achievements (20 defined with unlock criteria)

Animated achievement unlock modals with 8-bit styled effects and sounds

All gamification data stored locally

3.6 Theming & UI
Modernized 8-bit visual style: pixel fonts, retro UI elements, CRT effects

Dark mode option (default or user-toggle)

Interactive animations and sound effects for gamification events

3.7 Onboarding

Key app features

3.8 Performance & Scale
Designed to smoothly handle 100–500 job applications

Efficient rendering and local data handling to avoid lag

3.9 Platform Support
Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

Purely static frontend; no backend or server

Build process allowed to optimize/minify CSS and JS

3.10 Accessibility & UX
No special accessibility or keyboard shortcut requirements for now

Intuitive UI with pixel-art style buttons and forms

4. Data Handling & Storage
Use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistent local storage

Store all application data, XP, level, achievements, and settings locally

Data format: JSON objects keyed in local storage

Perform data validation on input forms (required fields, valid URLs, dates)

Prevent data loss on accidental navigation or refresh with autosave

5. Error Handling & Validation
Form validation:

Required fields (company, job title, date applied, status)

Valid URL format for job posting links

Salary range input validation (e.g. numeric or text accepted)

Graceful UI error messages on invalid inputs

Handle storage quota limits with fallback warnings (rare at this scale)

Catch and log JS errors gracefully; show fallback UI if critical failures occur

6. Testing Plan
6.1 Unit Testing
Test core functions: CRUD operations, XP calculations, achievement unlocking logic

Form validation functions and input sanitization

Local storage read/write correctness

6.2 Integration Testing
End-to-end flows: adding an application, updating status, adding notes

Gamification progression and level-up triggers

Achievement modal triggering and queueing multiple unlocks

6.3 UI/UX Testing
Responsive layout on various screen sizes and devices

Dark mode toggle functionality

Animations and sound effects performance and correctness

6.4 Performance Testing
Load test with 500 dummy job applications

Measure rendering time and interaction latency

6.5 Browser Compatibility
Test across latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

Validate local storage persistence on all supported browsers

7. Suggested Architecture & Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React (recommended for component-based UI, state management)

State Management: React useState/useReducer or lightweight global state (e.g. Zustand)

Styling: CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS with custom 8-bit inspired design tokens

Charts: Lightweight charting library (e.g. Chart.js or Recharts) with custom styling for 8-bit look

Local Storage: Wrapper abstraction around localStorage or IndexedDB for data persistence

Build Tool: Vite or Webpack for bundling and minification

Animation: CSS animations plus small JS-driven sprite animations

Audio: Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio with short 8-bit sound clips
